# ShadowScope Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-02-24

## Done
- M0 plumbing: Compose + migrations + idempotent ingest
- M3 investigator signal: ontology tagging + scoring + lead snapshots
- M4 baseline: entity/UEI/keyword correlations + API filtering + exports baseline
- M4.1 FOIA extension: seeded ingest + FOIA ontology + kw_pair + v2 default scoring + runbook

## Next
### M4.2 Workflow polish
- Export helpers (top leads / kw_pair to JSON/CSV)
- Improve entity linking coverage/fallbacks
- Document runbook parameters (Days/MaxRecords/MinScore/ScanLimit)

### M5 Multi-source
- SAM.gov ingestion/enrichment
- Cross-source joins and correlations

## Audit-derived expanded checklist (2026-02-24)

This section expands ROADMAP items with detailed, checklist-driven tasks discovered during a repo audit.
See `docs/AUDIT_BACKLOG_2026-02-24.md` for full reasoning + implementation notes.

### M4.2 Workflow polish (expanded)
- [ ] Export helpers:
  - [ ] top leads snapshot export (JSON/CSV)
  - [ ] top kw_pair clusters export (JSON/CSV)
  - [ ] lead deltas export (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] Ontology application quality:
  - [ ] include `raw_json` (safely stringified) in tagger input so rules can match it
  - [ ] fix ontology validation fidelity (default_fields handling)
  - [ ] optionally add ontology lint tool
- [ ] Scoring alignment:
  - [ ] make `/api/leads` default to v2
  - [ ] preserve v1 via explicit `scoring_version` param or legacy route
- [ ] API filtering usability:
  - [ ] add core filters to `/api/events` (source, date range, entity_id, keyword)
  - [ ] add filters to `/api/leads` (min_score, scoring_version, include_explanations)
  - [ ] add correlation filters (min_event_count, min_score_signal)

### M4.3 Relationship matrix: kw_pair count → signal
- [ ] Replace kw_pair `score=count` with a signal score:
  - [ ] Phase 1: PMI/NPMI or lift w/ smoothing + min counts + max df filters
  - [ ] Phase 2: log-odds / Fisher exact / Bayesian shrinkage for investigator-grade ranking
- [ ] Add “cluster explain” exports:
  - [ ] member events + co-terms + top clauses (aggregated)
  - [ ] (after schema enrichment) top agencies/PSC/NAICS breakdown per cluster
- [ ] Add new correlation lanes once schema supports it:
  - [ ] same_award_id / same_contract_id / same_doc_id
  - [ ] same_agency
  - [ ] same_PSC / same_NAICS
  - [ ] same_place_region (state/country)

### M4.4 Schema enrichment for richer lanes + filters
- [ ] Promote high-value USAspending fields to first-class columns (award id, agencies, PSC/NAICS, UEI, place region, amounts, action_date)
- [ ] Update OpenSearch mapping + reindex tool to index new fields
- [ ] Update API filters to use these fields

### M5 Multi-source (unchanged, but now with prerequisites)
- [ ] SAM.gov ingestion/enrichment
- [ ] Cross-source joins and correlations
- [ ] Leverage schema-enriched lanes for cross-source linkage
